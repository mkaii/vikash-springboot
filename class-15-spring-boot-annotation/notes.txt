What is annotation ? 

for exsmple @overide is a core java annotation which mkaes the child class of extended parent class overide the method found in the parent class. 
basically annotaion tells the code to do something, in this case it was to overide the method from the parent class

Annotation is actually the way we interact with spring boot framework. 

@SpringBootApplication annotaion we have in main, it consist of 3 basic anotaitons = 
1.@SpringBootConfiguration -> Configuration = Class level snnotation.Purpouse is creating bean methods ,Bean = is any java object which is handles by spring
only works when @Configuration is set on Class level and @Bean is set on methods if any of thesse are wmissing it will not work.thaycan togheter call methods which are responsible dor BEA/object creating
THis happens whn springboot starts it scans for the @Configuration and  @Bean and calls them.

2.@EnableAutoConfiguration  = All the configuration that needs to be done in the code hapens autoamatically we dont have to do it mnually ->
 application.properties  internal configuration and Autowiring

3.@CompenentScan  -> @component =  Class leve√∂ annotation on nany clas you write  is  and c reate constructor its object is getting created

to see where we can use what annotation we g to the @Target annotation 

@Autowired=
