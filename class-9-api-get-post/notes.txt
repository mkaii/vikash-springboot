 Parameterized method:when endpoint path refers to a parameterized method we can pass value in 3 ways:
1. path variable 
2.request param 
3 request body

client server architecture = client sends Http request to server. Server sends http response to client 
based on what client requests.These are basically called http messages.

Http message= contains the following parts: 
1. http methods = post,get,put,delete
2.path ""
3 query params = hashmap in key and value pairs. 
4.path variable = path/{""}
5.body = response body message in json 
6.headers = request headers and response headers.


Post http method  = you specify the variables contained in the item and you assign values.
 which you post to the desired location. via get http method you can confirm if the operation was successful.
