optional == is a container that has something in it or doesnt if a method that we call an we pass a avariable that method may not have that value so it will reurn null therfor
we could get nullpointerExpetion, instead we return a optional it basically if it find the value we are passing in the db it will retive that object put it into optional container and then return it
and if it does not find anything it will retrun the empty container. we can ask the continer if it contains the value or not if it does then we we do the approriate thing if it does or doesnt

.ispresent() will check if optional contains value 
.get() will return the value inside the optional 

.orElse() will return the value if it exist if not it will return the values we pass in method as default value


.orElseThrow() ---> same as get.()

mainly optional is used to tell the user that the value user may bee passing might not exist in the db and we need a way to handle such a case
