SQL = Structured Query Language  =


ex. 

Student class {
id
name
age              --------------->> Each object of student class will have id,name,age
                                   only values will change when we create multiple
                                   objects of cour class. In sql table the variables will
                                   be the columns and the values will be the rows
}

this is what we means when we say data is stored in  a structured way
each record of this tablehas one relation, it is some id,name and age.

rdbms -> relational  
all the records in this table has something uniqe all id  name and age
