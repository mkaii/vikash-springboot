calculator notes. 

oops = objects -> real world enteties, class is bluperint of that object.


passing object into class= we do it via set(object name)

null ponter = null.something.

Area calculator sould not have idea about specific shape or method calculation.
this can be achieved via interface.


interface can point to the child class object. 

the decision of which method to call is based on the type of object passed in to set()
parennt ref can only call the overideen abstract method in child classes not the other methods in child class.
