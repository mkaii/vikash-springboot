.m2-repository = when we add our cordinates of depency in our pom.xml file the jars needed is downloaded into the .m2 folder. This is where the external library acessing the jar from.
if we remove the dependecy in project the jars will still remain in the .m2 folder.
If we try to add back depencency in our project, as it it still saved in .m2 folder it directly acesses it from there and downloads into our local project instead of needing to
go to mvn remote repository.
