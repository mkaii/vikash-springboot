API = Application Programming Interface = Basically a method that is not local to your
system or application. Method is hosted on a server and can be accessed externally via endpoints.

 
xml/json = are common languages,api returns JSON. 

Extensible Markup Language:Xml data is sorted in a hierarchical structure, in levels based on 
opening and closing tags.Only leaf nodes contains values 

json: Javascript object notation. similar to xml but leaf nodes are stored in items and it does not use tags like xml.
This makes json more compact with easier readability and smaller file size.  
   


CRUD=  when performing crud operations regarding api we instead use POST,GET,PUT,DELETE to signify what action we want done, 
This is called HTTP methods. 


Endpoint= is an api that specifies http method and a method path, we can call an api via the endpoint. 


Postman= It is a tool for testing api, in browser we can only perform GET Http method but in
postman we can perform the remaining Http methods.
