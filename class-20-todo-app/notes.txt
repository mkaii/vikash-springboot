todo app 

funtionality = we shoudld be able to delete,add,update,mark if done/undone,

first step of coding is walways planning so here is the plan for app= 

1. Create todo class with all the variables required =  id,content,done,creationTimeStamp,dueDate and doneTimeStamp after that  generate getters and setters.
2. we want a list of todos so we will ceate TodoFactory class with @configuration and @Bean method  in hee we will pass Todo in listand it will return a new arraylist which initial value will be empty
this is the data scourse where we will be storing the toodos. 
3.Create Api = 
@Get-api: get all todos,get all done/undone todos,get todos close to dueDate and get todos done on time and not on time.
@Put-api: update specific content of a todo, mark as done/undone, update dudate of todo.if curretn time > dudate + limit --> mark as done.
@Post-api : add single/muliple todo the list
@Delete-api: remove one/muliple todos, remove marked todos past dueDate,remove unmarked todo after duedate. 

4.start creating the apis= 
1.create class TodoController add annotation @RestController 
2. check the type of bean in our case its List<Todo> someLoacalName; and Add @Autowired this is where the dependecncy injection will happen. bean will ceate object and hold
on to that, Atowired says i need an object  and sprinboot checks and injects object from the class with @Configuarion and @Bean annotaion.
