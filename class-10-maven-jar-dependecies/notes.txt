maven: a tool for manageing dependecies. a dependecy is basically a code which is not in my project 
but we want to import that code to be able to use the funcationality of that code.

Maven central repo : A location where all the dependencies and jar files are located. from which we can copy and paste in our pom.xml.
jar file is code packaged and compressed of which me can import to access classes in project,  not needed when using dependecy. 

dependecy : <atrifact id>
            <group id>
            <version>   = this are the uniqe combo to identify the dependacy via this we dont have to add the jar files manually
                          which can have direct depencensies and transitive dependencies using atrifact id, group id,and version 
                          solves this.

External libraries: this is where all the jar files of the depenndecies are downloaded(in the .m2 folder).


 Creating jar: we can create a jar file of project.
1.project structure 
2.artifacts 
3 add jar from modules with dependecies.
4.select Main class
5.build artifacts

iporting jar : we can import jar file in our new project. And we can it added in external libraries,
which we can call in our new project. 
1.project structure   
2.modules
3.dependencies 
4.add jars or directories
5.select jar from previous project
