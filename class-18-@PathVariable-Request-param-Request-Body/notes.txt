Request params =

query param and path is completly diffrent brow browser you can acess the path but everything else is hardcoded

reguest param is when we fill up the queries in browser via ?Key= value,  is a hashmap in other words key value pairs
to diffrentiate between key and value pairs we use & symbol.

when someone looks at the end point @PathVariable is better as you can for example see that user input is needed when we {} but in request params we need to check inside code


@RestController = Controller is the c part of te mvc architectyre this should be the entry point of the api   it should have  @Controller -> @component and also @RequestBody 

@RequestBody =
