API= Aplication Programming Interface 
        
             (endpoint url=API)
client(me) ---call method--->   server(contains methods),we can calll this a webervice 



here actually the API is the inteface between client and web service. it is an interface for the client 
to acess a webservice.API is not in the database or on the server it is only the acess pont for the server

Rest Api = Representational State Transfer( Architectual style )

we do not send the actual object insted we send a state  of the object(represaentatio nof the state in form of JSON)
Rest api design practises :

1. use jsn for sending anfd reciving data sending via requestbody recieveing via responsebody 
2.Use nouns insted of verbs, for ex. do not write @Getmapping("getAll/todos") instead  @Getmapping(todos) getmapping is already indicating what kind of api it is
only and what the api is trying todo should be a part od the path we can also make the consulsion that is muliple todos because its in plural
3.Error status codes = 
client error = it is when there is a faulty request och api does not exist 
server eror  = code level error 
100-199 = informational responses for ex 102 indicates resource being processed
200-299 = code went ok 
300-399 = Redirects for.ex 301 means moved permanently
400-499 = Client-side-errors for ex 400 means bad request and 404 means not found
500-599 = Server-side-errors for.ex 500 means internal server eror

Nesting endpoints = todos/undone = here we have nested two nouns = we want those todos that are marked undone. 

filtering,sorting and pagination = 
pagination : iving the rult in pages insted of giving the whole result
sorting: for example we sorted our todos base don urgent todos
filtering: for example i want to see all the dodos that are marked as done/undone

versions= insted of changing existing api yu should  version your api. This makes it poosible for user to stay on prevoius version 
and only if they want they can shift to new version.

provide accurate api documentaion = there is a tool known as swagger it will generate doccumentation based on your code nly, tellsyou what is the endpoint,give samples and so on
